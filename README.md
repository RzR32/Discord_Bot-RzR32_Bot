# RzR32 Discord-Bot (based on [JDA](https://github.com/DV8FromTheWorld/JDA))

```
The main function of the bot is it, to capture and save the activities of the members,
if desired a role is added to each game and can then be mentioned.
```

## Features
In addition to the main function, the bot has a few **counter**, like ...

- `GUILD`
    - Member
    - Role
    - Category
    - TextChannel
    - VoiceChannel
- `GAME`
    - Game (games in the file)
    - GamePlaying
- `OTHER`
    - TwitchFollower [The API for this counter is not mine (https://api.crunchprank.net/twitch/followcount/$user), so if its not work, I cant help for the moment]
 
Also indicates when a member...
+ joins / leaves
+ change his nickname

(needs 11 java to start!)
